    <h1>Mollie Bricker: The Cutest Golden Retreiver in the World</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="first">

  <p>This is Mollie. She is the third pure-bred Golden Retreiver my family has had, so it goes without saying that I'm biased in my opinion that there is no pet better than a Golden.</p>
  <p>We adopted Mollie when she was 1 1/2 years old from a divorced couple who didn't love her enough to treat her well. Mollie is now 8 years old and incredibly spoiled by me and my parents because we <s>think</s> know she's the greatest thing that's ever happened to the world.</p>

  <div id="second">

  <p>In true Retriever nature, Mollie is rarely seen without a stuffed animal in her mouth. We like to call them her "babies" and she has accumulated quite the collection. When she has some down time, she likes to snuggle up with as many babies as possible. I buy her a new baby almost every time I leave the house. I mean, who could resist that face?</p>
  </div>
  <div id="third">
    <img src="mom.jpg"/>
    <p>We love to take selfies with Mollie. Since I'm away at school most of the time, my mom sends me hundreds of pictures of Mollie. Half are taken with my mom and half are taken with her babies.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="fourth">
  <img src="petmeds.jpg"/>
  <p>We also love to pretend that Mollie is a model. She gets so excited when the PetMeds box comes in the mail because she's smart and knows it always comes with a bone. Sometimes it's hard to get her to pose for pictures and, even though she was excited, she ended up looked so serious.</p>
  <p>Mollie is the cutest Golden Retreiver in the world and we love showing her off to the world.</p>
